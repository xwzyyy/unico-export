# unico-export

`unico-export` is the Open Design plugin for generating and updating pages for the Unico DND canvas.

All skill sources and generated IR content are English-only. Compiler validation rejects CJK strings.

## Workflow

1. Read `unico-page.json` from the active project when it exists.
2. Treat its `designJson` array as the current canvas.
3. Read the style families in `references/design-style-library.md`, then run UI/UX Pro Max design-system guidance and the controlled-variation stage in `references/design-optimization.md`.
4. Apply the user's request while preserving unrelated sections and component properties. Existing components are not round-tripped through IR.
5. Compile the updated design with `compiler/unico-ir-compiler.mjs`.
6. Review the final type-specific component completeness audit.
7. Write the complete result back to `unico-page.json`.
8. Also write `unico-export-result.json` for older integrations.

For normal edits, set `mode: "extend"` in `unico-design-ir.json` and include only new sections. The compiler reads the existing canonical page, keeps all current component objects unchanged, appends the new compiled sections, and writes the complete result back. Use `mode: "replace"` only for an explicitly requested full redesign.

The canonical file is a complete envelope, not a patch:

```json
{
  "designJson": [
    "...complete Unico component array..."
  ],
  "message": "summary of the update"
}
```

If `unico-page.json` does not exist, create it from the newly generated page. The compiler always writes `unico-export-result.json` so validation errors are inspectable, but writes or updates `unico-page.json` only after validation passes. A malformed existing canonical page is never silently replaced.

Validation covers JSON/envelope structure, stable unique IDs, 386px bounds, section height, text sizing and overlap, background layering, intentional image fitting and crop focus, non-empty media, fixed-component isolation, component-selection policy, and supported component types. A final independent audit checks every emitted component's required root, structure, style, config, link, fixed-property, and nested-tab fields. The result also reports composition metrics and non-blocking quality warnings.

Text components follow the fixed Unico contract and omit the `height` style control. When rich-text height is omitted, the compiler estimates it conservatively from content, padding, font size, and available width, then adds a mandatory `20px` clipping buffer. Explicit rich-text heights are rejected when they are below that buffered estimate. New or upgraded `designProfile` records must include UI/UX Pro Max research, a page-level semantic theme, and a selected controlled-variation direction; explicit section/component colors must reuse that theme's tokens so sections cannot drift into unrelated palettes. Legacy profiles without the new optional metadata remain compilable with an upgrade warning. Network images must use verified CDN direct URLs with explicit commercial-use license evidence in the IR `assetManifest`; image-provider detail pages and unknown/non-commercial licenses are rejected. Image components compile to the structured `Image Content`/`Image Upload` crop contract, including `cropArea`, `crop.transform`, editor scale/rotate/translation controls, radius, and custom CSS. Ratio-mismatched `cover` images are zoomed enough to fill the frame, while unknown source dimensions default to `1.20`. `inquiry-box` omits width and naturally fills its runtime container. See [`references/verified-image-sources.md`](references/verified-image-sources.md) for source, license, attribution, and validation rules.

Button horizontal and vertical padding both default to `0`. Rectangle cards without explicit height automatically include their foreground content; insufficient explicit heights fail validation. Every new image must come from web search and use a verified HTTP(S) raster-image direct URL whose source page explicitly permits commercial use. The matching `assetManifest` entry must include license and attribution evidence. SVG, local files, data/blob URLs, unknown/editorial/non-commercial licenses, and generated image sources are forbidden.

Event List, Service List, Product List, Blog, Coupon, Inquiry, Map, Store Information, and other business components each occupy one ordering carrier in IR. Compilation removes the carrier and emits the component directly beside other `free-box` entries.

## Component policy

- Use `text`, `img`, `button`, `rectangle`, and compiler-generated `free-box` containers frequently.
- Use `rich-text` moderately and only for mixed formatting.
- Use each of `banner`, `blog-list`, `service-list`, `event-list`, `event-calendar`, `store-information`, `inquiry-box`, `goods-list`, and `map` at most once and only when context warrants it.
- Never use deprecated `img-text` or `circle`.
- Use all other registered components only after an explicit user request, recorded in IR `explicitComponents`.

## Compatibility

`unico-export-result.json` remains available for older DND clients, but `unico-page.json` is authoritative whenever both files exist.

## Component coverage

The compiler supports every component currently registered by the DND AI import validator, including navigation, banner, search, store information, product, promotion, coupon, service, event, calendar, and blog components. Business components keep runtime data collections empty so the component can fetch current store data through its built-in API behavior.
